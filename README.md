## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure my code, program, or software is functional and secure by implementing thorough automated testing throughout development. This includes writing unit tests, integration tests, and security tests to maximize code coverage. I also make sure to test edge cases and unexpected inputs to strengthen the softwareâ€™s reliability. Additionally, I regularly review and update the code to address any potential vulnerabilities, and I stay informed about best practices for secure coding.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs by carefully reviewing and analyzing user stories, which describe the features and functions users expect. I ask clarifying questions when needed to fully understand the requirements. Then, I break down these needs into specific tasks or features that can be developed and tested, ensuring the final product aligns closely with what the users actually want.

## How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I start by researching the problem area and gathering user requirements, often through user stories. I then create pseudocode, diagrams, or an outline to plan the structure and flow of the program before writing any real code. This helps me organize my thoughts, anticipate potential challenges, and design a solution that is logical, efficient, and user-centered.
